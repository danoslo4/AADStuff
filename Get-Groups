<# This is a quick script to get a list of user groups an AD user is a member of.
Note: You will need to run this script from a machine with the ActiveDirectory module installed and have the appropriate permissions to run the Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership cmdlet.

#TODO: Combine these scripts into one to produce a CSV file with all group memberships, noting which ones are cloud and which ones are On Premises

## Active Directory
# Import the ActiveDirectory module
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

# Define the user you want to check the group membership for
$User = "JohnDoe"

# Get the group membership for the user
$Groups = Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership $User | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name

# Export the group membership to a CSV file
$Groups | Export-Csv -Path "C:\GroupMembership_$User.csv" -NoTypeInformation


## Azure Active Directory

# Import the AzureActiveDirectory module
Import-Module AzureAD

# Define the user you want to check the group membership for
$userPrincipalName = "<UserPrincipalName>"
$user = Get-AzureADUser -Filter "userPrincipalName eq '$userPrincipalName'"

# Get the group membership for the user
$groupMemberships = Get-AzureADUserMemberOf -ObjectId $user.ObjectId

# Export the group membership to a CSV file
$groupMemberships | Select-Object DisplayName, ObjectId | Export-Csv -Path "AADGroupMemberships_$userPrincipalName.csv" -NoTypeInformation
